<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Our expertise lies in accessibility driven development. Whether we are designing a website or Evaluating for a VPAT Certification we always
use POUR design principals by WCAG to meets accessibility requirements.</p>

<p>The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), it is used to evaluate accessibility standards for Section 508 (U.S.), EN 301 549 (EU), and W3C/WAI WCAG.
Some companies are required to fill out a VPAT before they can release a new product, others may need one to Certify that they have met the Accessibility
requirements. We use the VPAT to certify that our sites are ADA compliant.</p>

<h2>VPAT Evaluation</h2>

<p>A VPAT Evaluation is a process we use to examine your site and verify that accessibility standards have been satisfied to level AA.
During this process, we will crawl your site, use evaluation tools, as-well-as manually go through the site using assistive technologies.
We test the site for hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities, deafness or low-hearing, just to name a few</p>

<h2>VPAT Certifications</h2>
<p>Our certification process is easy. After we complete an evaluation we use one of the four (4) VPAT documents to Certifications your site meets the
required standards and is in compliance with Sections 508, EU, or WCAG. </p>
