<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A VPAT is the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template developed by the ITI. It evaluates the leading ICT accessibility standards: Section 508 (U.S.),
EN 301 549 (EU), and W3C/WAI WCAG 2.x. Some companies are required to fill one out before they can relese a new produce, others may want one to Certify
that they have meet the Accessibilty requirements.</p>

<p>ITI has developed four (4) editions of the VPAT Document:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>VPAT 2.2 508</strong>: Revised Section 508 standards – the U.S. Federal accessibility standard</li>
  <li><strong>VPAT 2.2 EU</strong>: EN 301 549 – the European Union’s “Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe”</li>
  <li><strong>VPAT 2.2 WCAG</strong>: WCAG 2.0 or ISO/IEC 40500 – W3C/WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guideline</li>
  <li><strong>VPAT 2.2 INT</strong>: Incorporates all three of the above standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>All four editions of the VPAT® contain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Product Description field that briefly describes the product.</li>
  <li>An Evaluation Methods Used field to describe methods used to test the product’s accessibility.</li>
  <li>A Notes field for the report and for each table to provide additional detail concerning the product tested and the evaluation methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey provides you with a PDF version of the document that can either be uploaded to their website or sent by email upon request.</p>

<p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Please Note</strong></span>: While a VPAT® can be an essential aid in assessing the accessibility of products,
it is important to note that, even in cases where a product conforms to relevant standards and technical specifications, an end user may still encounter difficulties
utilizing it due to the nature or severity of his or her disability. On the other hand, a product that may not fully conform to all technical requirements may still
be perfectly accessible to an end user who has a disability, but does not need a particular accessibility feature, e.g., a large-button telephone handset for an
individual with a hearing disability.</p>

<p>While there may not be a perfectly accessible product, many can still be used effectively and efficiently by most people with disabilities. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey
offers to assist companiend and business with understanding and filling out a VPAT.</p>

<h2>Certifications</h2>
