<h1>VPAT Document</h1>

<p>Our expertise lies in accessibility driven development. Whether we are designing a website or Evaluating for a <strong>WCAG</strong> Certification we always
use <span class="text-uppercase"><strong><em><a href="https://www.kaffeinatedkodemonkey.com/faq#collapseThree">POUR</a></em></strong></span> design principals by <strong>WCAG</strong> to meets accessibility requirements.</p>

<p>We use the <span class="text-dark">Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</span>, for our <strong>WCAG</strong> Certifications that follows the accessibility standards for Section 508 (U.S.), EN 301 549 (EU), and W3C/WAI <strong>WCAG</strong>.
Some companies are required to fill out a VPAT before they can release a new product, others may need one to Certify that they have met the Accessibility
requirements. We use the VPAT to certify that our sites are ADA compliant.</p>

<h1>Accessibility Evaluation</h1>

<p>An Accessibility Evaluation is a process we use to examine your site and verify that accessibility standards have been satisfied to level AA.
During this process, we will crawl your site, use evaluation tools, as-well-as manually go through the site using assistive technologies.
We test the site for hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities, deafness or low-hearing, just to name a few.</p>

<h1>WCAG Certification</h1>
