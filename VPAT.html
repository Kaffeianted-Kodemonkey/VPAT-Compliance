<h2>Disclamer</h2>

<p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Please Note</strong></span>: A VPAT® Certification can be an essential aid in assessing the accessibility of products,
it is important to note that in cases where a product conforms to relevant standards and technical specifications, an end user may still encounter difficulties
utilizing the site due to the nature or severity of his or her disability. On the other hand, a product that may not fully conform to all technical requirements may still
be perfectly accessible to an end user who has a disability, but does not need a particular accessibility feature, e.g., a large-button telephone handset for an
individual with a hearing disability.</p>

<p>While there may not be a perfectly accessible product, many can still be used effectively and efficiently by most people with disabilities. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey
offers to assist companiend with understanding a VPAT.</p>
