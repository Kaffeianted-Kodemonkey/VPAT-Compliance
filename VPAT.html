<h2>What is a VPAT?</h2>

<p>A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (<span class="text-uppercase">VPAT</span>) is a document which evaluates how accessible a particular product is
according to the WCAG & Section 508 Standards. It is a self-disclosing document which details each aspect of the WCAG & Section 508 requirements and how the
product supports each criterion.</p>

<p>The VPAT documents are built on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for criteria and require all section to conform to these requirements for each
level (A, AA, AAA) of conformance as well as the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>

<p>VPATs are complex and confusing, often time the person who receives a VPAT doesnâ€™t have the skills to understand and interpret the document all its requirements.
This can be frustrating unless you have an accessibility specialist on staff. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey has a team of experts to handle this for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes when a company attempts to complete the VPAT on their own they may not be completely honest and list numerous problems even if they are minor because it
means their team has added work to their load. When hiring a third party you can rest assured that all issues will be accurately notated. With Kaffeinated Kodemonkey's team,
we will stand with you in this process.</p>
