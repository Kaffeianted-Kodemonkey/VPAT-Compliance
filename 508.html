<h1>What is Section 508</h1>

<!--<p>If your business is a federal government agency, or receives funding/assistance from the federal government then you have to abide by section Section 508
requirements.</p>-->

<p>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requiring Federal agencies to make electronic documents accessible to people with disabilities.
Section 508 applies to all Federal agencies when it pertains to electronic and information technology. Government agencies must give disabled employees and members
of the public access to the same or comparable information as they do others.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Access Board</a> is responsible for developing accessibility standards that govern Federal
procurement practices. January 2017, they issued a final rule that updated accessibility requirements for section 508 and refreshed guidelines to Section 255.</p>

<p>The refresh reorganized Section 508 Standards and Section 255 Guidelines in response to market trends and innovations in technology. The refresh also
harmonized these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission, and
W3C guidelines know as WCA.</p>

<h2>What is WCAG</h2>

<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) process in cooperation with individuals and
organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals,
organizations, and governments internationally.</p>

<p>The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web "content" generally refers to the information in a web
page or web application, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural information such as text, images, and sounds</li>
  <li>code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>WCAG is becoming a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p>
