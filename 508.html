<h2>Does 508 Apply to my website?</h2>

<p>If your business is a federal government agency, or receives funding/assistance from the federal government then you have to abid by section Section 508
requirements.</p>

<p>In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make electronic documnts accessible to people with disabilities.
Section 508 applies to all Federal agencies when it pertains to electronic and information technology. Government gencies must give disabled employees and members
of the public access to the same or comparable information as they do others.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Access Board</a> is responsible for developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility standards to incorporate into regulations that
govern Federal procurement practices. On January 18, 2017, the Access Board issued a final rule that updated accessibility requirements covered by Section 508, and
refreshed guidelines for telecommunications equipment subject to Section 255 of the Communications Act. The final rule went into effect on January 18, 2018 and has
been commonly refered to as the "Refesh".</p>

<p>The refesh reorganized Section 508 Standards and Section 255 Guidelines in response to market trends and innovations in technology. The refresh also
harmonized these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission, and
with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and ICT.</p>

<h2>We are doing our part</h2>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is an Accessibility Driven Development company. We believe in designing <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> websites that follow the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) princapals.</p>

<p>WCAG focuses heavily on the principles of accessibility and encourages developers to think through the process conceptually. The four main guiding principles of accessibility are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>P</strong>erceivable</li>
  <li><strong>O</strong>perable</li>
  <li><strong>U</strong>nderstandable</li>
  <li><strong>R</strong>obust</li>
</ul>

<p>Conveniently, these principles spell out an acronym that is relatively easy to remember: <strong><em>POUR</em></strong>. The idea is to create a <strong><em>POUR</em></strong>
website, so to speak. It is sufficient to say that putting the <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> principles to work helps put people at the center of the process, which, in the end, is the whole reason for
everything we do.</p>

<p>Why we strive to design <strong><em>POUR</em></strong> websites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To improve the lives of people with disabilities (human-centered motivations)</li>
  <li>To capitalize on the a wider audience or consumer base (marketing or economic-centered motivations)</li>
  <li>To avoid lawsuits and/or bad press (public relations and punishment-centered motivations)</li>
</ul>
