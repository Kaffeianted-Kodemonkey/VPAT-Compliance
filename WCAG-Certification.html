<h1>WCAG Certification</h1>
<p>In order for your product to become WCAG Certified it has to meet all WCAG criteria to be considered compliant.</p>

<p>Therefore we will conduct a full evaluation and submit a How-To-Fix document notating any issues found that need to be resolved for us
to issue a WCAG Certification. In some cases, we can issue a partial certification that allows you time to resolve issues and become completely certified.</p>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey offers four (4) types of Certifications:</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>WCAG-EU Certification</strong>: WCAG plus European Union’s Accessibility requirements for EU compliance</li>
  <li><strong>WCAG-Int Certification</strong>: Incorporates all three of the above standards for Full Compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Certification is comprised of a Web Accessibility Statment, a VPAT document and our certification badge indicating the level of compliance and date certified. </p>

<h2>What is an Accessibility Evaluation?</h2>

<p>Accessibility Evaluation is a process of examining a product to verify it meets the <strong>WCAG</strong> criteria standards up to level AA.
This process is done through an automated evaluation via our accessibility script to programming analyzes the structure of each page.</p>

<p>This gives our Accessibility Expert a deeper analysis of each page. By return the number of Errors – Alerts – Features – Structural Elements – HTML5 &
Aria Constant Errors our expert can further test the site for hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities,
deafness,low-hearing, and more through assistive technology.</p>

<p>Once completed we will submit a How-To-Fix document outlining any issues and how to resolve them.</p>

<h2>What is a VPAT Document?</h2>

<p>Our expertise lies in accessibility driven development. Whether we are designing a website or Evaluating for a <strong>WCAG</strong> Certification we always
use <span class="text-uppercase"><strong><em><a href="https://www.kaffeinatedkodemonkey.com/faq#collapseThree">POUR</a></em></strong></span> design principals by <strong>WCAG</strong> to meets accessibility requirements.</p>

<p>We use the <strong>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)</strong>, for our <strong>WCAG</strong> Certifications that follows the accessibility standards for Section 508 (U.S.), EN 301 549 (EU), and W3C/WAI <strong>WCAG</strong>.
Some companies are required to fill out a VPAT before they can release a new product, others may need one to Certify that they have met the Accessibility
requirements. We use the VPAT to certify that our sites are ADA compliant.</p>

<h2>What is an Accessibility Statment?</h2>

<p>This is a Statment we will create for you to place on your website along with your other site policy statements. An Accessibility Statment let's
your users understand how your site is accessible, the technology used and generally outlines your steps to compliance.</p>
