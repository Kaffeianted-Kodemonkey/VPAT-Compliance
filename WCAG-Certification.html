<h2>VPAT Evaluation</h2>
<p>Through an automated evaluation of the code structure, our Accessibility Experts can determine if your site meets the WCAG criteria set forth on the VPAT document.</p>

<p>Our Accessibility Expert also analyses each page for Errors – Alerts – Features – Structural Elements – HTML5 & Aria - Constant Errors, testing the site for hands-free access, vision impairedness, low-vision, color-blind, learning disabilities,
  deafness,low-hearing, and more through assistive technology.</p>

<p>Once completed we will issue a VPAT document based on the results. </p>

<h2>VPAT Document</h2>
<p>The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (<span class="text-uppercase">VPAT</span>) is a document which evaluates how accessible a particular product is according to the WCAG & Section 508 Standards. It is a self-disclosing document produced
  by the vendor which details each aspect of the WCAG & Section 508 requirements and how the product supports each criteria.</p>

<p>VPATs are used by buyers to determine how accessible a product is and where any potential deficiencies are. They are required by some buyers before a purchase is made.</p>

<p>The official VPAT forms are hosted by the Information Technology Industrial Council and are available in the Microsoft Word format.</p>

<p>The VPAT contains documentation on WCAG & Section 508 (2017 Refresh), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.x Success Criteria & Conformance Requirements (Levels A, AA, AAA) as well as the European Accessibility standards EN 301.</p>
