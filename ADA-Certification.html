<h2>Who should be Certified?</h2>

<p>All websites, online documents, and web application should have a certification.</p>

<p>When a website follows the <strong>WCAG</strong> guidelines it helps increase search engine and marketing efforts. Search Engines are essence disabled.
They can't see or hear and when a website is designed using the <strong><i>POUR</i></strong> principals it allows the search engined spiders to see and hear thus pushing your site
above others less accessible.</p>
