<h2>Welcome to our Accessibility Information Center</h2>

<p>We keep up on the ever-changing of Web Accessibility and VPAT documents so you do not have to.</p>

<p>Our experts stay informed about new versions and how they will affect you. We want to make sure that all Certifications
we issue are at the current version and level that the <strong>WCAG</strong> and <strong>VPAT</strong> have to offer. In doing so we thought we would share
our research and findings with you.</p>
