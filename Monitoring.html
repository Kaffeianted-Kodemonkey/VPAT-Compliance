<h2>Keeping you on top of your game</h2>

<p>So far we have been talking about all this VPAT, 508, WCAG stuff but how do you keep track of it? Or do you?</p>

<p>Now you may already have a VPAT that you, your developer or someone else did for you. Are you aware that it is only valid
for one (1) year? This is where we come in to save the game.</p>

<p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey help companies and business large or small Goverment or local stay compliant. We have partnerd with a company
that has developed a platform that will crawl your website, analizie it for Accessibility and send a report to you letting you know if
there were any issues found.</p>
