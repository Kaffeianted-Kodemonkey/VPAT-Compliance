<h2>Why Monitor Accessibility?</h2>

<p>Websites are always changing and so are the WCAG requirements.</p>

<p>You have user-generated content, for example, School may allow departments to manage content for their section, developers may be adding new features
or updating current ones. This can become a daunting process trying to keep up with it all and train users on new accessibility requirements.</p>

<p>Our goal is to keep companies, business, schools, and Governments in line with WCAG and Section 508 requirements.</p>

<p>We offer a platform that helps monitor your website for accessibility and notifies you of any Accessibility issues and how to improve them.
Knowing which accessibility issues your team/organization makes most frequently can help with in house training and your staff becomes more efficient.</p>

<p>The monitoring platform is powered by time-tested and popular WAVE accessibility evaluation engine offering the best in Accessibility Monitoring.</p>
